# AIR v1 — EAT Claim Mapping

**Issue:** #69
**Status:** v1.0 FROZEN
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Companion:** `cddl/air-v1.cddl` (wire schema)

This document maps every AIR v1 receipt field to its CWT/EAT claim, CBOR key, type constraint, and verification semantics. It is the normative bridge between the M0 scope documents and the CDDL schema.

## 1. COSE_Sign1 Envelope

AIR v1 receipts use COSE_Sign1 (RFC 9052 §4.2), CBOR tag 18.

```
COSE_Sign1 = [
  protected   : bstr,       ; serialized protected header map
  unprotected : map,         ; unprotected header map
  payload     : bstr,        ; serialized CWT claims map
  signature   : bstr .size 64  ; Ed25519 signature
]
```

The signature covers `Sig_structure1 = ["Signature1", protected, external_aad, payload]` where `external_aad` is empty (`h''`).

### 1.1 Protected Header

| Label | Name | Value | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | alg | -8 (EdDSA) | Ed25519 with verify_strict. Verifiers MUST reject other values. |
| 3 | content type | 61 | `application/cwt`. Identifies payload as CWT claims. |

### 1.2 Unprotected Header

The unprotected header MUST be empty for AIR v1 receipts. Unprotected parameters are not covered by the COSE signature and can be tampered in transit. Verifiers MUST reject receipts with non-empty unprotected headers.

AIR v1 does not use `kid` or any other unprotected header parameter. If key identification is needed in a future v1.x revision, it should be carried in the protected header.

## 2. Standard CWT/EAT Claims

These claims use IANA-registered CWT integer keys.

### iss (Issuer) — key 1

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CWT key | 1 |
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Identifies the issuing entity (e.g., `"cyntrisec.com"`, `"customer.example.com"`). |
| Verification | Informational. Verifier MAY check against an expected issuer allowlist. |

### iat (Issued At) — key 6

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CWT key | 6 |
| CBOR type | uint |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the inference completed. Maps to v0.1 `execution_timestamp`. |
| Verification | FRESH check: `now - max_age <= iat <= now + clock_skew`. Verifier SHOULD reject future timestamps. |

### cti (CWT ID) — key 7

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CWT key | 7 |
| CBOR type | bstr .size 16 |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Receipt identifier. UUID v4 encoded as 16 raw bytes (not the 36-char string form). Maps to v0.1 `receipt_id`. |
| Verification | Verifiers maintaining replay state SHOULD track seen cti values. |
| Migration note | v0.1 used `receipt_id` as a text UUID. v1 uses raw bytes in cti. Display as UUID string for human readability. |

### eat_profile — key 265

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CWT key | 265 |
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Fixed value: `"https://spec.cyntrisec.com/air/v1"`. Identifies this receipt as AIR v1. |
| Verification | Verifiers MUST reject receipts with unknown eat_profile values. |

### eat_nonce — key 10

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CWT key | 10 |
| CBOR type | bstr .size (8..64) |
| Required | No (optional) |
| Semantics | Challenge nonce provided by the client to bind the receipt to a specific request session. Size constraint per RFC 9711 §4.1: 8-64 bytes. |
| Verification | If the verifier supplied a nonce, it MUST check that eat_nonce matches. Primary replay resistance mechanism when verifier-side cti dedup is not feasible. |

## 3. AIR Private Claims

These claims use negative integer keys to avoid collision with IANA CWT claim registry. Range -65537 to -65548 assigned (required); -65549 assigned (optional). Range -65550 to -65599 reserved for v1.x extensions.

### model_id — key -65537

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Human-readable model identifier (e.g., `"minilm-l6-v2"`). Operator-assigned, opaque. |
| Verification | MODEL check: verifier MAY compare against expected value. Not cryptographic — use model_hash for binding. |

### model_version — key -65538

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Human-readable model version (e.g., `"1.0.0"`). Operator-assigned, opaque. |
| Verification | MODEL check (combined with model_id). Not cryptographic. |

### model_hash — key -65539

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | bstr .size 32 |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | SHA-256 of model weights. The cryptographic binding between the receipt and a specific model artifact. |
| Verification | MHASH check: verifier MUST compare against a known-good hash when model identity matters. This is the primary model identity proof. |
| Hash scheme | See `model_hash_scheme` (key -65549, optional) for how the hash was computed. When absent, treat model_hash as opaque. |

### request_hash — key -65540

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | bstr .size 32 |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | SHA-256 of the raw wire bytes of the inference request as received by the workload. Binds the receipt to a specific input. |
| Verification | Client holding the original request bytes can recompute and compare. AIR v1 does not define a canonicalization scheme for request payloads. |

### response_hash — key -65541

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | bstr .size 32 |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | SHA-256 of the raw wire bytes of the inference response as emitted by the workload. Binds the receipt to a specific output. |
| Verification | Client holding the original response bytes can recompute and compare. |

### attestation_doc_hash — key -65542

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | bstr .size 32 |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | SHA-256 of the platform attestation document (Nitro COSE doc, TDX quote, etc.). Links the receipt to TEE evidence. |
| Verification | Verifier SHOULD independently obtain and verify the attestation document, then compare its hash. AIR v1 does not define attestation document verification (see limitations L-3). |

### enclave_measurements — key -65543

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | map |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Platform measurement registers. Structure depends on measurement_type (see §4). |
| Verification | MEAS check: all pcr0/pcr1/pcr2 values MUST be exactly 48 bytes. MTYPE check: measurement_type MUST be a recognized platform string. |

### policy_version — key -65544

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Version of the policy governing this workload (e.g., `"policy-2026.02"`). |
| Verification | Informational. Verifier MAY compare against an expected policy version. |

### sequence_number — key -65545

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | uint |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Monotonically increasing counter within a single workload session. Resets on restart. |
| Verification | Verifiers processing a stream SHOULD check monotonicity. Gaps indicate missed receipts (within a session). |

### execution_time_ms — key -65546

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | uint |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Wall-clock inference time in milliseconds. |
| Verification | Informational. Anomalously low or high values may indicate issues but are not a verification failure. |

### memory_peak_mb — key -65547

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | uint |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Peak memory usage during inference in megabytes. |
| Verification | Informational. |

### security_mode — key -65548

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | Yes |
| Semantics | Security mode of the workload (e.g., `"GatewayOnly"`, `"FullAttestation"`). |
| Verification | Informational. Verifier MAY require a specific security mode. |

### model_hash_scheme — key -65549

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CBOR type | tstr |
| Required | No (optional, RECOMMENDED) |
| Semantics | Declares how `model_hash` was computed. Enables verifiers to reproduce the hash from model artifacts. |
| Verification | If present, verifier MUST recognize the scheme. Unknown schemes MUST be rejected (fail-closed). If absent, verifier treats model_hash as opaque (can still compare against known-good hash, but cannot reproduce it). |

**Defined scheme values:**

| Scheme | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `"sha256-single"` | SHA-256 of a single model weights file. This is the default for single-file models (e.g., SafeTensors, GGUF, ONNX). |
| `"sha256-concat"` | SHA-256 of deterministically concatenated weight files. Files MUST be concatenated in lexicographic filename order. The concatenation order MUST be reproducible from the model artifact directory. |
| `"sha256-manifest"` | SHA-256 of a manifest document that lists per-file hashes. The manifest format is implementation-defined but MUST be self-describing (i.e., the manifest contains enough information to verify each file independently). |

**Extensibility:** New scheme values MAY be registered in v1.x minor updates. Implementations MUST NOT invent unregistered scheme values.

**Issue:** #80 (RESOLVED)

## 4. Measurement Map Variants

The `enclave_measurements` claim (key -65543) contains a map whose structure depends on the `measurement_type` field inside it.

### 4.1 Nitro PCR (`measurement_type = "nitro-pcr"`)

| Field | CBOR Type | Required | Description |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `"pcr0"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | PCR0 — SHA-384 |
| `"pcr1"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | PCR1 — SHA-384 |
| `"pcr2"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | PCR2 — SHA-384 |
| `"pcr8"` | bstr .size 48 | No | PCR8 — SHA-384 (optional) |
| `"measurement_type"` | tstr | Yes | `"nitro-pcr"` |

### 4.2 TDX MRTD/RTMR (`measurement_type = "tdx-mrtd-rtmr"`)

| Field | CBOR Type | Required | Description |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `"pcr0"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | MRTD — SHA-384 |
| `"pcr1"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | RTMR0 — SHA-384 |
| `"pcr2"` | bstr .size 48 | Yes | RTMR1 — SHA-384 |
| `"measurement_type"` | tstr | Yes | `"tdx-mrtd-rtmr"` |

### 4.3 Cross-Platform Naming

TDX registers are mapped to `pcr0`/`pcr1`/`pcr2` field names for verifier simplicity. The `measurement_type` field disambiguates semantics. This allows a single verifier codepath for measurement validation.

## 5. Migration from v0.1 Claims

| v0.1 Field | v1 Claim | Key | Change |
|------------|----------|-----|--------|
| `receipt_id` (tstr UUID) | `cti` | 7 | Text UUID → 16-byte bstr |
| `protocol_version` (uint) | `eat_profile` | 265 | Integer → profile URI string |
| `execution_timestamp` (uint) | `iat` | 6 | Same semantics, standard CWT key |
| `signature` (bstr in map) | COSE_Sign1 signature field | — | Moved out of claims into envelope |
| `previous_receipt_hash` | — | — | Removed in v1 (pipeline is vNEXT) |
| _(new)_ | `model_hash` | -65539 | New required claim, no v0.1 equivalent |
| _(new)_ | `eat_nonce` | 10 | New optional claim for replay resistance |

## 6. EAT Profile Declaration (RFC 9711 §6.3)

This section consolidates the mandatory profile positions per RFC 9711 §6.3.

| Declaration | AIR v1 Position |
|---|---|
| **Profile identifier** | URI: `"https://spec.cyntrisec.com/air/v1"` (carried in `eat_profile`, key 265) |
| **Encoding** | CBOR only (RFC 8949). JSON serialization is not defined. |
| **Envelope** | COSE_Sign1 (RFC 9052 §4.2), CBOR tag 18. Untagged COSE_Sign1 MUST be rejected. |
| **Payload content type** | COSE content_type = 61 (`application/cwt`). The payload is a CWT claims map. |
| **HTTP media type** | `application/eat+cwt` (RFC 9782). Receivers SHOULD accept both `application/cwt` and `application/eat+cwt`. |
| **Signing algorithm** | Ed25519 only (COSE alg = -8). `verify_strict` required (canonical S per RFC 8032 §5.1.7). No algorithm negotiation in v1. |
| **Detached bundles** | Not supported in v1. The attestation document is referenced by hash (`attestation_doc_hash`), not embedded. |
| **Key identification** | Out of band. The verifier obtains the Ed25519 public key through a platform-specific channel (e.g., attestation document, key registry). AIR v1 does not use `kid` or any other unprotected header parameter. |
| **Mandatory claims** | 16 required: iss, iat, cti, eat_profile, model_id, model_version, model_hash, request_hash, response_hash, attestation_doc_hash, enclave_measurements, policy_version, sequence_number, execution_time_ms, memory_peak_mb, security_mode. |
| **Optional claims** | 2 optional: eat_nonce (replay resistance), model_hash_scheme (hash computation method). |
| **Freshness** | `iat` carries execution timestamp (Unix seconds). Verifier applies `max_age` + `clock_skew` policy. `eat_nonce` provides optional challenge-response replay resistance (RFC 9711 §4.1, 8–64 bytes). |
| **Deterministic encoding** | Required. Map keys sorted per RFC 8949 §4.2.1 (shorter encoded form first, then bytewise lexicographic). |
| **Closed map** | The claims map is closed: unknown integer keys MUST be rejected. Duplicate keys MUST be rejected. |
| **Unprotected header** | MUST be empty. AIR v1 does not use `kid` or any other unprotected header parameter. Verifiers MUST reject receipts with non-empty unprotected headers. |
| **Private claim keys** | -65537 to -65549 (private use per RFC 8392). No IANA registration required. Keys -65550 to -65599 reserved for v1.x extensions. |

## 7. v1.x Extension Rules

1. New optional claims MAY be added in v1.x minor versions using keys -65550 to -65599.
2. New claims MUST NOT be required — a v1.0 verifier must still accept v1.x receipts.
3. New measurement_type variants MAY be added (e.g., `"sev-snp-vcek"` for AMD SEV-SNP).
4. The protected header MUST NOT gain new required fields in v1.x.
5. New `model_hash_scheme` values MAY be registered in v1.x minor updates.
